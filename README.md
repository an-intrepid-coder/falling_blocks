# FALLING BLOCKS

**Description:** This is a clone of the well-known game of falling puzzle blocks. It is written in C and relies on the ncurses library. It runs the whole game in the terminal when the user runs the executable and then resumes business-as-usual when the game is over. **'a', 's', 'd'** keys to move left, down, and right. **'f'** key to rotate the tetromino.

**Options:** `-easy`, `-medium`, and `-hard` set the size of the speed decrements for each new level (so harder means the blocks fall faster sooner). `-ascii` and `-solid` set the symbols used for the tetromino blocks (solid gives a more arcade-like appearance). By default no color is used.

**State of the Project:** pre-0.0.1. Like a car with just an engine, wheels, and frame.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a professional programmer, although I did enjoy making this a lot. Compile and run at your own risk.
